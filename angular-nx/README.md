# Angular + Nx

_Building scalable Angular applications with Nx monorepo tooling._

## Overview

Nx is a smart, extensible build framework that pairs beautifully with Angular for managing complex monorepos. It brings structure, speed, and developer experience improvements to large-scale applications.

## Key Concepts

**Monorepo Architecture**
Multiple apps and libraries in a single repository, with clear boundaries and shared code.

**Generators**
CLI commands that scaffold components, libraries, and apps with best practices baked in.

**Affected Commands**
Run tests/builds only on code affected by your changes ‚Äî huge time saver in large repos.

**Computation Caching**
Local and distributed caching prevents redundant builds and test runs.

**Dependency Graph**
Visual representation of how projects relate to each other. Helps understand impact of changes.

## Common Workflows

- Creating feature libraries vs. UI libraries
- Sharing code between multiple Angular apps
- Enforcing module boundaries with lint rules
- Optimizing CI with affected commands and caching
- Migrating from Angular CLI to Nx
