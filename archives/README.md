# ðŸ““ The Archives: Where It All Started

_My handwritten notes from learning to code â€” confusion, breakthroughs, and the messy middle._

## Why This Exists

Before I was writing documentation for production systems, I was filling notebooks trying to make sense of for-loops, closures, and why `this` kept betraying me in JavaScript.

**These scanned pages are from my coding bootcamp days** â€” the raw, unfiltered process of going from "What is a function?" to building real applications. They're messy. They have question marks in the margins. They have crossed-out explanations where I got it wrong the first time.

And that's exactly why they belong here.

**Because good documentation starts with remembering what it's like to not understand.**

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't a comprehensive archive of everything I learned. It's a curated collection of moments that mattered:

- **Aha moments** â€” Pages where a concept finally clicked
- **Confusion captured** â€” Notes with lots of "Why???" and "How does this work?"
- **Visual thinking** â€” Diagrams I drew to make sense of abstract concepts
- **Mistakes documented** â€” Wrong assumptions I corrected later
- **Analogies and metaphors** â€” Early attempts at "explain like I'm five"

These notes show the same instinct that drives this entire repo: **if I'm confused, I write it down until it makes sense.**

## The Bootcamp Context

**When:** 2020-2021
**Where:** UPenn LPS Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp 
**Before bootcamp:** Non-technical background, learning to code from scratch
**After bootcamp:** Software engineer building production applications

The transition wasn't magic. It was hundreds of hours of:
- Writing things down
- Drawing diagrams
- Asking "why?" repeatedly
- Explaining concepts back to myself
- Documenting what finally made it click

**These notebooks are proof that documentation isn't just for experts.** It's how you *become* one.

## What I Notice Now

Looking back at these notes years later, a few things stand out:

**1. I was always trying to explain concepts simply**
Even as a beginner, I was translating technical jargon into plain language. That instinct became my approach to documentation.

**2. I drew a lot of diagrams**
Visual models helped me understand abstract concepts. You'll see boxes and arrows trying to make sense of scope, closures, event loops, and React component trees.

**3. I asked a lot of "why" questions**
I wasn't satisfied with "that's just how it works." I needed to understand the reasoning. That curiosity shows up in every doc I write now.

**4. I documented my mistakes**
Pages where I got it wrong, then corrected myself. Mistakes aren't failures â€” they're learning captured.

**5. Metaphors everywhere**
Even then, I was reaching for relatable comparisons: "Promises are like ordering coffee..." "React state is like a whiteboard..."

**These patterns didn't go away. They became my method.**

## How to Read These Archives

Each folder contains:
- **Scanned pages** â€” Original handwritten notes (as-is, no cleanup)
- **README context** â€” What I was learning, what was hard, what I'd explain differently now

Read these chronologically to see the progression, or jump to topics that interest you.

**Important:** These are learning artifacts, not tutorials. They capture the messy process of figuring things out, not polished explanations.

## The Bigger Picture

This repo documents my journey from bootcamp notebooks to production-level technical writing.

**The archives show where documentation started for me: in confusion, curiosity, and the need to write things down to understand them.**

That's still how I approach documentation today. I just have better handwriting (well, I type now).

The tools changed. The instinct didn't.

## Archive Folders

### **[MongoDB: When Tables Stopped Making Sense](./mongodb-learning-journey/README.md)** â€” March 2020

My bootcamp notes learning NoSQL and MongoDB. The "class thursday march 4" breakthrough when SQL vs NoSQL finally clicked, pizza app diagrams with Mongoose, and the handwritten comparisons that became the "filing cabinet vs storage bins" metaphor. 9 pages showing the journey from "why would you duplicate data?" to "sometimes you want everything in one place."

Perfect companion to my [MongoDB Quick Reference](../mongodb/README.md).

---

### **[ORM & MVC: The Translation Layer](./orm-mvc-architecture/README.md)** â€” 2020

Learning how ORMs bridge JavaScript and SQL databases through Sequelize. The moment when "models" clicked as translators between objects and tables, understanding MVC architecture, and figuring out how to structure backend code. 7 pages capturing the breakthrough of "I don't have to write raw SQL anymore."

---

### **[Algorithms: When Efficiency Started to Matter](./algorithms-problem-solving/README.md)** â€” 2020

My first exposure to Big O notation, time complexity, and algorithm analysis. Bubble sort diagrams, understanding why "it works" isn't always good enough, and learning to think about scalability before writing code. 5 pages showing the shift from "does it work?" to "how fast does it work at scale?"

---

### **[JavaScript: When Async Stopped Being Magic](./javascript/README.md)** â€” 2020

The JavaScript runtime, event loop, call stack, and memory heap explained through diagrams. Plus advanced concepts: closures, functional programming vs OOP, the "this" keyword, event delegation, and module systems. 11 pages capturing the evolution from "JavaScript is weird" to "JavaScript makes sense once you understand the runtime."

---

### **[Auth & Cloud: When Security Became Real](./backend-auth-cloud/README.md)** â€” 2021

Learning JWT authentication and AWS cloud deployment. Understanding bearer tokens, authorization flow, stateless auth, and the difference between authentication ("who are you?") and authorization ("what can you do?"). 2 pages showing when security and deployment became non-negotiable parts of building applications.
