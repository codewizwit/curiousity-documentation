# 🧩 The HIPA Moment: Curiosity in Culture

_Why the highest paid person in the room doesn't always have the best idea. And why everyone deserves a seat (and voice) at the table._

## The Moment That Changed How I Show Up

For a long time, I was the quiet one in the room. Timid. Drowning in imposter syndrome. The person who had ideas but kept them to myself because speaking up felt risky.

I didn't even know what a "bean" was in Java. And instead of asking, I stayed quiet. Because asking felt like admitting I didn't belong there.

I was told I needed more confidence. That feedback stung, but it wasn't wrong. I did stay quiet when I had something to say. When I had questions that might have helped me learn faster. When I was confused but assumed everyone else understood.

Then I heard a conference speaker say something that stuck with me:

**"The highest paid person in the room doesn't always have the best idea."**

That line changed everything.

It gave me permission to speak up. To ask "what's a bean?" when I didn't know. To share half-formed ideas. To question the plan even when everyone else seemed on board.

I started finding my voice. Asking questions. Contributing ideas. Learning that speaking up didn't mean I didn't belong. It meant I was engaged.

And that engagement changed my career. Speaking up eventually led to me contributing impactful architectural decisions, proposing CI/CD testing strategies that improved our workflows, and leading high-impact projects. The person who was once too afraid to ask about Java beans was now shaping technical direction.

But then I realized something else.

**I wasn't the only quiet person in the room.**

When you've been the person too afraid to ask basic questions, you start noticing when others are in that same position. When someone hesitates. When they start to speak but stop. When they nod along but look confused.

That's when I learned that curiosity isn't just about asking my own questions or sharing my own ideas. It's about **listening** more intentionally. It's about creating space for voices that might not speak up on their own, especially when silence feels safer than honesty.

**Because I know exactly how that feels.**

What changed for me wasn't just speaking up more. It was learning to **make space for others** to speak. To listen first. To invite input, not just wait for it.

**This isn't about how we build systems. It's about how we build trust.**

## Everyone Has a Seat (and Voice) at the Table

Having a seat at the table isn't enough. You also need to feel safe using your voice when you're there.

**Regardless of seniority. Regardless of experience.**

We've all been in meetings where some voices are heard more than others. It makes sense why this happens: when hierarchy is clear, speaking up can feel risky. When senior folks have already weighed in, it's easier to nod along than to offer a different perspective.

**But here's what I learned: a seat without a voice is just furniture.**

And it's on all of us, especially those with seniority or established credibility, to actively create space where every voice can be heard.

Creating space means:
- **Inviting input explicitly:** "What do you think?" directed at the quiet person
- **Pausing for thinking:** Not filling every silence with more talking
- **Rewarding honesty:** Thanking people for disagreeing or questioning
- **Modeling vulnerability:** Saying "I don't know" or "you might be right"
- **Making it safe to be wrong:** Ideas don't have to be perfect to be valuable

When everyone has a voice, not just a seat, better ideas surface. Edge cases get caught. Assumptions get challenged. Teams get stronger.

**You can't mandate psychological safety. But you can model it.**

## What HIPA Actually Means

HIPA: **Highest Paid Person's Answer**

It's the invisible force in every meeting where the senior person speaks first, and suddenly everyone else's half-formed ideas evaporate. Not because they were bad ideas. Because the room just got heavier.

HIPA isn't malicious. It's human. We naturally defer to experience, to seniority, to the person who's "been here longer." That instinct makes sense. But it can also mean quieter voices don't get heard.

**What we might miss:** The junior dev who noticed the edge case. The designer who saw the UX flaw. The QA engineer who spotted the architectural risk.

Not because they didn't want to share. Because speaking up feels vulnerable when you're newer, less senior, or worried your question might sound "dumb."

**And that's completely understandable.** The question is: how do we create environments where it feels safer?

## Why This Matters in Tech

Tech moves fast. The "right answer" changes every year. The framework that was best practice two years ago might be legacy debt now. The senior engineer who's been here 10 years might not know the new deployment tool better than the intern who just learned it in bootcamp.

**Curiosity levels the playing field.** But only if we make space for it.

**What happens when hierarchy dominates the conversation:**
- Decisions get made faster, but with less diverse input
- Quieter voices fade over time (it becomes a pattern)
- Mistakes take longer to surface (questions feel riskier)
- Innovation slows (new perspectives don't get heard)
- Onboarding gets harder (new people learn to stay quiet)

**What happens when curiosity wins:**
- More ideas get heard (even half-baked ones spark better solutions)
- Edge cases surface earlier (saving hours of debugging later)
- Team trust grows (people feel safe contributing)
- Better decisions emerge (from collaboration, not hierarchy)
- Psychological safety becomes the norm (not the exception)

## How I Started Making Space

After that conference, I started doing things differently. Not by speaking more, but by **listening more intentionally** and creating room for others.

### 1. Listen for What Isn't Being Said

The most valuable input often comes from the people who haven't spoken yet.

In meetings, I started noticing:
- Who's nodding but not talking
- When someone starts to speak but stops
- When the room goes quiet after the senior person weighs in

Those moments are opportunities. Not to fill the silence myself, but to invite someone else in.

**Listening isn't passive. It's actively creating space.**

### 2. Invite Quieter Voices First

If I'm running a meeting or leading a discussion, I ask the people who haven't spoken yet.

"What do you think?"
"Does this make sense from your perspective?"
"What am I missing?"

Because once the senior person (or the loudest voice) speaks, the room shifts. But if newer voices speak first, their ideas get heard on their own merit.

**You can't build psychological safety by accident. You have to create it on purpose.**

### 3. Ask Questions Even When I "Should" Know

Early in my career, I'd stay quiet if I thought the answer was "obvious." I didn't want to look inexperienced.

Now? I ask anyway.

"Wait, can you explain why we're using this approach?"
"What if we tried it this way instead?"
"I'm not sure I follow. Can you walk me through that?"

Half the time, someone else had the same question. The other half, the question sparks a better idea. And it shows the team that asking questions is safe.

**Curiosity isn't ignorance. It's intentional learning. And it's contagious.**

### 4. Say "I Don't Know" Out Loud

Admitting uncertainty used to feel like weakness. Now I know it's leadership.

"I don't know. Let's figure it out together."
"Good question. I hadn't thought of that."
"You might be right. Let's test it."

When the "expert" admits they don't have all the answers, it gives everyone else permission to think out loud too.

**Vulnerability invites curiosity. Certainty shuts it down.**

### 5. Challenge Ideas, Not People

There's a difference between "that won't work" and "I'm worried about X. How would we handle that?"

One shuts down the conversation. The other opens it.

I try to ask questions instead of making declarations:
- "Are we making decisions on behalf of the user?"
- "How would this scale?"
- "What's the worst case scenario here?"

**Curiosity interrogates the idea, not the person.**

### 6. Document the "Why," Not Just the "What"

When I write docs, I explain the reasoning behind decisions. Not just what we built, but why we built it that way.

Because future-me (or future-teammate) will wonder "why did we do it like this?" And if the answer isn't documented, they'll either repeat past mistakes or waste time second-guessing good decisions.

**Curiosity doesn't end when the work ships. It's how we learn from what we built.**

## Modeling Safety: The Quarterly Dev Retro

I experienced the power of **leadership-free retrospectives** on my last team. It was one of the most psychologically safe spaces I'd been part of. Recently, I got to lead one myself, and saw firsthand how transformative this practice is.

Here's the pattern that works:

### The Setup
Run a quarterly dev retro **without any leadership in the room**. Just the dev team. No managers, no directors, no product owners. Just engineers.

This creates space for honest conversations that might feel too risky when hierarchy is present.

### During the Retro
Document the **good, the bad, and the ugly** in a trusting environment. Everything is fair game:
- What's working well (celebrate wins)
- What's frustrating (process bottlenecks, technical debt)
- What's broken (the stuff people are afraid to say out loud normally)

The key: **psychological safety first**. People need to know this is a judgment-free zone.

### After the Retro
The leading dev (or facilitator) synthesizes what they heard into **overall themes**, not individual comments. This is critical. No one should be able to trace a concern back to a specific person.

Then create **actionable suggestions** based on those themes. Not complaints. Solutions.

### Before Sharing Up
Run the synthesized themes and suggestions **by the dev team first**. Make sure they feel comfortable with how it's framed. This isn't about reporting on the team. It's about advocating for them.

### Presenting to Leadership
Share the themes and actionable suggestions with your triad (or leadership, or the entire team, depending on your org). Frame it as "here's what the team is experiencing" and "here's what would help."

Then **assign action items**. Come up with solutions together. Track progress.

### Why This Works
- **Builds trust**: Devs see that their honest feedback leads to real change
- **Empowers voices**: People learn that speaking up is safe and productive
- **Creates accountability**: Leadership can't ignore patterns when they're clearly documented
- **Models vulnerability**: The senior engineer shows that listening and advocating is leadership

**This practice says: "I'm using my position to create space for your voice, not to speak over it."**

And over time, that trust translates into people speaking up more in regular meetings too. Because they know they'll be heard.

## The HIPA Antidote: Curiosity-First Meetings

Here's what I've learned about running meetings where curiosity beats hierarchy:

### Before the Meeting
- Share context early (don't surprise people with big decisions)
- Invite input async first (some people think better in writing)
- Make it clear all ideas are welcome (explicitly say it)

### During the Meeting
- Start with the quiet voices (don't let seniority dominate)
- Ask "what am I missing?" (invite challenge)
- Pause for thinking (silence isn't awkward, it's processing)
- Restate ideas neutrally (separate the idea from who said it)

### After the Meeting
- Document the decision AND the reasoning (future context matters)
- Thank people for speaking up (reinforce the behavior)
- Follow up on questions (even the ones that felt "small")

**The goal isn't consensus. It's making sure the best idea wins, regardless of who said it.**

## When It's Hard to Speak Up

Let's be real: speaking up feels riskier when you're newer, less senior, or still building credibility. That's not a personal failing. That's how hierarchies work.

**If you're in this position, here's what I wish I'd known earlier:**

### Your Questions Aren't Dumb
If you're confused, someone else probably is too. Your question might clarify things for the whole room.

### Your Perspective Is Valuable
You see things others don't. Fresh eyes catch what experienced eyes overlook. Your newness is an advantage, not a weakness.

### You Don't Have to Speak First
Timing matters. You don't need to be the first voice in the room. But you also don't have to stay silent forever. Find your moment.

### Written Words Can Feel Safer
If speaking up in meetings feels vulnerable, try sharing your idea in Slack or email first. Some of the best ideas come from async conversations.

### Find Your Allies
Look for the people who ask questions and make space for others. Sit near them. They'll make space for you too.

### Start Small
One question per meeting. One observation shared in writing. One "I'm not sure I follow" when you're confused. Small steps build the muscle.

**Curiosity is a skill, not a personality trait. You can practice it. And you don't have to do it alone.**

## Real Examples Where Curiosity Saved the Day

### The Intern Who Caught the Security Flaw
Senior team designed an auth flow. Intern asked "what happens if someone manually changes the token?" Team realized they hadn't validated expiration server-side. Intern's question prevented a major vulnerability.

**Lesson:** Fresh eyes ask "dumb" questions that uncover real risks.

### The Designer Who Questioned the Feature
Product wanted a complex dashboard. Designer asked "do users actually need all this data at once?" User research showed they didn't. Simplified design shipped faster and tested better.

**Lesson:** Asking "why" can prevent building the wrong thing.

### The Junior Dev Who Suggested the Simpler Solution
Team was debating microservices vs monolith. Junior dev asked "why not start simple and split later if needed?" Team realized they were over-engineering for scale they didn't have yet.

**Lesson:** Sometimes the best answer is the simplest one. Seniority doesn't equal correctness.

## How to Build a Curiosity-First Culture

You can't fix team culture alone. But you can model the behavior you want to see.

**If you're junior:**
- Ask one question per meeting (start small)
- Share one idea in writing (async feels safer)
- Notice when others stay quiet (invite them in too)

**If you're senior:**
- **Listen first, speak last** (let quieter voices go first)
- Pause before answering (create space for others)
- Say "I don't know" when it's true (model vulnerability)
- Thank people for disagreeing (reward intellectual honesty)
- Ask "what am I missing?" (genuinely invite challenge)

**If you're leading:**
- Create explicit space for questions (make it part of the process)
- Reward curiosity visibly (recognize people who speak up)
- Make decisions transparent (explain the "why")
- Notice who hasn't spoken (invite them in directly)

**Culture isn't what you say. It's what you reward. And what you make space for.**

## The Connection to Documentation

This entire repo exists because I believe curiosity should be documented.

When I figure something out, I write it down. Not just for me. For the next person who has the same question.

**Documentation is an act of curiosity and generosity.**

It says: "I was confused once. Here's what helped me. Maybe it'll help you too."

That's the same energy behind making space in meetings. Behind asking questions when everyone else is quiet. Behind saying "I don't know" when you don't.

**Curiosity in culture looks like curiosity in code: making space for learning, not just knowing.**

## Reflection

Every great chess player was once a beginner. Every senior engineer once asked "what's a function?"

The difference isn't talent. It's documented hours. And most of those hours involve asking questions.

**HIPA only wins when we let it.** When we assume the loudest voice or the highest title has the best idea.

**But curiosity wins when we make space for it.** When we ask "what if" even when it feels risky. When we value the question as much as the answer.

That conference talk didn't just change how I show up at work. It changed what I document, how I lead, and who I make space for.

**Because the best ideas don't come from hierarchy. They come from teams that make curiosity safe.**

Still learning. Still asking. Still making space. 🌭
