# 🧭 Curiosity Documentation

_A living notebook for everything I’ve taken apart to understand better._

This repo is my personal learning lab. A collection of concise READMEs that document how different tools, frameworks, and developer-experience systems work under the hood.
Each folder represents a topic I've explored while building or debugging in real projects — from **pnpm** and **Nx** to **GitHub Actions**, **Angular**, testing with **Cypress**, **Playwright**, and **Jest**, and **JWTs**.

The goal isn’t to teach exhaustively; it’s to make sense of things I was curious about and keep those notes in a searchable, reusable form.

## 🧩 Why this exists

I learn best by documenting what I figure out.  
Writing things down turns curiosity into clarity — and clarity into better code.  
This repo captures that process in public, so others can learn (or correct me) along the way.
