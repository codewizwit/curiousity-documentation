# 🌭 Curiosity Documentation
_A living notebook where curiosity meets code._

Welcome to my curiosity lab: part experiment, part documentation binge, part "wait, how does that actually work?" moment.

This is where I document until things make sense.
It's not perfect, but it's honest, and usually a little weird (in the best way).

## 🤓 Why This Exists

Because documentation is how I think and remember. And because curiosity is the best dev skill no one puts on their résumé.

**Five years of the same instinct:** If I'm confused, I write it down. If I figure it out, I document it. If I build it, I explain it like I'm eight. Started in bootcamp with handwritten notebooks, question marks in margins, and crossed-out mistakes. Still doing it now, just typed.

**This repo is new, but the habit isn't.** These notes lived in Notion for years. I moved and enhanced them here to make them easier to search, share, and reference. Plus, I didn't want to be an information hoarder - documentation should be for everyone, not just me.

If you've ever Googled something and wished the explanation actually made sense, welcome home.

## 🔍 How I Actually Use This

- **Reference when I forget**: "Wait, how do Lambda cold starts work again?" → search this repo, find my own explanation, remember why I wrote it that way
- **Onboarding teammates**: "Here's how GitHub Actions secrets work" → link to docs instead of explaining for the 5th time
- **Debugging amnesia**: Past-me documented the solution. Present-me just needs to remember where I put it
- **Proof I'm learning**: Tracking how my understanding evolved from "what's a closure?" (2020 notebooks) to "here's how to optimize serverless architecture" (production docs)
- **Interview prep**: Turns out documenting everything you learn is the best study guide you'll ever make

Basically: if I took the time to figure it out, I document it. Future-me always thanks past-me.

## 🚀 Real Projects (Where This Gets Used)

These docs aren't just theoretical. They're built from real production work, informing how I build and ship software.

**[Human in the Loop](https://github.com/codewizwit/human-in-the-loop)**

A production toolkit for centralized AI governance, bringing order to scattered prompts, agents, and AI tools across teams.

**What it does:** CLI for discovering, installing, and managing versioned AI prompts and agents with built-in quality controls and adoption tracking.

**Published:** [@human-in-the-loop/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@human-in-the-loop/cli) on npm

**Technologies from this repo:**
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Nx monorepo architecture
- pnpm workspace management
- npm publishing pipeline
- Jest for testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

This project lives the concepts documented here: Nx monorepos, pnpm workspaces, npm publishing, and the [Responsible AI](./responsible-ai/README.md) principles through its Developer-First Accountability Framework.
