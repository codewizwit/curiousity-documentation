# 🧭 Curiosity Documentation

_A living notebook documenting the journey from bootcamp to production._

**Built by Alexandra Kelstrom** — a software engineer who puts people first. I am a documentation enthusiast and love to make documentation that is relatable, and simple to understand. I approach engineering with curiosity and empathy, breaking down complexity with metaphors and documenting the journey from confusion to clarity.

**This repo shows the full arc:** from handwritten bootcamp notebooks (2020-2021) learning "What is a function?" to production-level documentation on complex systems. Some topics come from building or debugging real projects. Others are rabbit holes worth exploring. From **bootcamp notes on JavaScript runtime and algorithms** to **responsible AI**, **accessibility**, **Angular signals**, **NestJS**, **Next.js**, **GitHub Actions**, **TypeScript**, **ancient pyramid engineering**, **pnpm**, **Nx**, testing with **Cypress**, **Playwright**, and **Jest**, and **JWTs**... If I wanted to understand how it really works, it's documented here.

The goal isn't to teach exhaustively; it's to capture the learning process — from confused beginner to confident engineer — in a searchable, reusable form.

## 🧩 Why this exists

I learn best by documenting what I figure out.
Writing things down turns curiosity into clarity; and clarity into better code.

**This habit started in bootcamp** — filling notebooks with diagrams, questions, and "aha moments" to make sense of JavaScript closures, event loops, and Big O notation. That instinct never went away; it just evolved from handwritten notes to production documentation.

This repo captures that entire journey in public, so others can learn (or correct me) along the way.

  <p><em>My documentation philosophy in a nutshell.</em></p>

Every topic here is broken down with metaphors, relatable examples, and the kind of explanations that would make sense to your past self when you first encountered the concept. No gatekeeping. No assuming prior knowledge. Just clear, honest learning in public.
