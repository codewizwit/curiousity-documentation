# Testing with Cypress

_End-to-end testing that doesn't make you want to flip tables._

## Overview

Cypress is a modern testing framework built for the web. It runs in the browser alongside your app, giving you fast, reliable, and debuggable tests for real user workflows.

## Key Concepts

**Real Browser Testing**
Tests run in actual Chrome/Edge/Firefox, not simulated environments.

**Time Travel Debugging**
Hover over commands to see exactly what happened at each step. Snapshots make debugging visual.

**Automatic Waiting**
No more `sleep()` or arbitrary timeouts. Cypress waits for elements and assertions automatically.

**Network Stubbing**
Mock API responses to test edge cases without needing backend changes.

**Component Testing**
Test individual components in isolation, not just full page flows.

## Common Patterns

- Testing user authentication flows
- Form validation and submission
- API integration with fixtures
- Handling dynamic content and loading states
- Visual regression testing with snapshots
- CI integration for automated test runs
